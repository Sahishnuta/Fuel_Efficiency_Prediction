## Problem Statement

**Predicting Vehicle Fuel Efficiency (MPG) using Machine Learning**

The project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the fuel efficiency (miles per gallon - MPG) of vehicles based on various automotive characteristics and specifications.

### Key Objectives:
1. **Regression Problem**: Predict continuous numerical values (MPG) rather than categories
2. **Feature Analysis**: Identify which vehicle attributes most significantly impact fuel efficiency
3. **Model Comparison**: Evaluate multiple machine learning algorithms to find the best performer
4. **Data-driven Insights**: Provide actionable insights for automotive manufacturers and consumers about fuel efficiency factors

### Input Features:
The model uses various vehicle attributes including:
- Engine specifications (cylinders, displacement, horsepower)
- Vehicle characteristics (weight, acceleration)
- Manufacturing details (model year, origin)
- And potentially other automotive metrics

### Business/Real-world Applications:
- **Automotive Industry**: Help manufacturers design more fuel-efficient vehicles
- **Consumers**: Assist car buyers in making informed decisions about fuel economy
- **Environmental Impact**: Contribute to reducing carbon emissions through better fuel efficiency
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Aid in meeting fuel efficiency standards and regulations

## Technical Analysis

### Dataset:
- Likely using the classic Auto MPG dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository
- Contains automotive data from the 1970s-1980s era
- Target variable: MPG (continuous numerical value)

### Methodology:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, data cleaning, feature engineering
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Understanding relationships between features and target
3. **Model Training**: Implementing multiple regression algorithms
4. **Model Evaluation**: Using metrics like RÂ², MSE, RMSE, MAE
5. **Feature Importance**: Identifying key predictors of fuel efficiency

### Expected Models:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees/Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)
- Possibly Neural Networks

### Challenges:
- Handling multicollinearity among automotive features
- Dealing with non-linear relationships
- Ensuring model generalizability across different vehicle types
- Interpreting model results for practical applications

This is a classic regression problem in machine learning that combines automotive engineering knowledge with data science techniques to solve an economically and environmentally significant real-world problem.
